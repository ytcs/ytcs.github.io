  Welcome! My name is To Chin (first) Yu (last). I am an aspiring particle physicist interested in dark matter and BSM searches. Particle physics is the study of fundamental constituents of the physical universe and their interactions. In the past 60 years we have accumulated overwhelming evidence for the existence of particle dark matter - a new type of matter with almost no non-gravitational interaction with ordinary matter - in our universe. The exact nature and properties of these mysterious particles are of great interest to the physics community and numerous experiments aimed at searching and detecting these particles have been devised.

Among the many dark matter theories I find most interesting a class of theories called “hidden sector”. These theories believe that the particle physics of dark matter can be as rich and complex as the “visible sector”, and encompasses many particle species and interactions. If found to be true it may lead to answers to some long-standing questions in particle physics, and perhaps also to even more perplexing questions to be solved by generations to come…
