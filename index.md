  Welcome! My name is To Chin (first) Yu (last). Previously I was a particle physicist interested in dark matter detection and a member of the <a href="https://supercdms.slac.stanford.edu/">SuperCDMS</a> collaboration. I have since switched gears to studying the physics of financial markets which, perhaps somewhat surprisely, has a lot of deep connections to particle physics. This page is where I post about technical ideas that I find interesting.
