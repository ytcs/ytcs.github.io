Welcome to my blog where I explore physics, mathematics, and finance. Co-written by LLM.

### Some Mathematical Expressions

The quadratic formula: \\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)

Einstein's famous equation: \\( E = mc^2 \\)

The normal distribution:

\\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} \\]
