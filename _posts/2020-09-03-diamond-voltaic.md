title:  "Diamond Nuclear Battery"
---
It turns out that any particle detector can be turned into a battery when combined with a radioactive source. In particular, people have started working on diamond nuclear voltaics. Currently the efficiency is still pretty low (7%) and power output is at the micro-Watt level. Nonetheless it is a very interesting idea and will potentially also drive advancement in CVD technology.
