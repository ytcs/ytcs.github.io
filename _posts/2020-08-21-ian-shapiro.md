The discussion on the collapse of USSR is particularly interesting. Supporters of Yeltsin paraded the Russian flag and replaced the CPSU flag with the Russian one. This distinction between nationists and communists is something that is not pervalent in China as the CCP actively promotes the notion that "the party is the country". I wonder if a nationalist identity that is decoupled from the CCP will emerge in the future. Perhaps we should have a flag of China that is not associated with any particular political party:
