In the previous parts of this series, we've explored the foundational principles of mechanistic interpretability, the superposition hypothesis, and mathematical frameworks for transformer analysis. Now we turn to one of the most powerful conceptual frameworks in the field: **neural network circuits**. Moving beyond individual features, circuits capture the computational relationships and information flow patterns that enable complex behaviors, providing a bridge between low-level neural activations and high-level algorithmic understanding.

## Circuit Definition and Scope

Neural network circuits represent a fundamental shift in how we conceptualize neural network computationâ€”from viewing networks as monolithic black boxes to understanding them as compositions of interpretable computational subgraphs.

### Fundamental Circuit Concepts

**Definition:** A *neural network circuit* is a computational subgraph consisting of features (nodes) connected by weighted edges that collectively implement a specific algorithm or computational function.

**Mathematical Formalization:** A circuit $$\mathcal{C}$$ can be formally defined as:

$$\mathcal{C} = (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{W}, f_{\mathcal{C}})$$

where:
- $$\mathcal{F} = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n\}$$ is the set of features (nodes)
- $$\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F}$$ is the set of directed edges
- $$\mathcal{W}: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ assigns weights to edges
- $$f_{\mathcal{C}}: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$$ is the overall function computed by the circuit

**Circuit Computation:** The computation performed by a circuit can be expressed as:

$$\mathbf{y} = f_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma\left(\sum_{(f_i, f_j) \in \mathcal{E}} w_{ij} \cdot a_{f_i}(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{v}_{f_j}\right)$$

where $$a_{f_i}(\mathbf{x})$$ is the activation of feature $$f_i$$ on input $$\mathbf{x}$$, $$w_{ij}$$ is the edge weight, and $$\mathbf{v}_{f_j}$$ is the output vector of feature $$f_j$$.

### Scale Hierarchy in Circuit Analysis

One of the most important insights from circuit analysis is that meaningful computational units exist at multiple scales, each requiring different analytical approaches.

**Micro-Circuits:** Small, focused computational units:
- 2-10 features performing specific operations
- Examples: edge detection, color processing, basic logical operations
- Direct correspondence to classical computer vision algorithms
- High interpretability and clear functional roles

**Meso-Circuits:** Intermediate-scale functional modules:
- 10-100 features implementing complex algorithms
- Examples: object recognition pathways, attention mechanisms
- Composition of multiple micro-circuits
- Balance between interpretability and computational power

**Macro-Circuits:** Large-scale computational systems:
- 100+ features implementing high-level behaviors
- Examples: language understanding, complex reasoning
- Hierarchical organization with multiple levels
- Challenging interpretability but crucial for understanding model capabilities

**Scale-Dependent Analysis Strategies:** Different scales require different analytical approaches:

$$\text{Analysis Complexity} \propto |\mathcal{F}|^{\alpha} \cdot |\mathcal{E}|^{\beta}$$

where $$\alpha \approx 1.5$$ and $$\beta \approx 1.2$$ based on empirical observations.

### Circuit Identification Methodology

**Bottom-Up Discovery:** Starting from individual features and building circuits:

1. Initialize with individual features $$\mathcal{F}$$
2. For each feature pair $$(f_i, f_j)$$:
   - Compute connection strength $$w_{ij}$$
   - If $$w_{ij} > \tau_{\text{threshold}}$$, add edge $$(f_i, f_j)$$ to $$\mathcal{E}$$
3. Apply clustering to identify circuit modules
4. Validate circuits through ablation studies

**Top-Down Decomposition:** Starting from behaviors and identifying implementing circuits:

1. Define target behavior $$B$$
2. Identify features most relevant to $$B$$
3. Trace information flow through network layers
4. Isolate minimal sufficient circuit for $$B$$
5. Validate through intervention experiments

**Hybrid Approaches:** Combining bottom-up and top-down methods:
- Use top-down to identify candidate regions
- Apply bottom-up analysis within regions
- Cross-validate findings between approaches
- Iteratively refine circuit boundaries

### Circuit Validation Framework

Understanding circuits requires rigorous validation to distinguish genuine computational relationships from spurious correlations.

**Necessity Testing:** Verifying that circuit components are required:

$$\text{Necessity}(f_i) = \frac{\text{Performance}(\mathcal{C}) - \text{Performance}(\mathcal{C} \setminus \{f_i\})}{\text{Performance}(\mathcal{C})}$$

**Sufficiency Testing:** Verifying that the circuit is sufficient for the behavior:

$$\text{Sufficiency}(\mathcal{C}) = \frac{\text{Performance}(\mathcal{C})}{\text{Performance}(\text{Full Model})}$$

**Causal Intervention Protocols:** Systematic testing of circuit hypotheses:
- *Ablation studies*: Removing circuit components
- *Activation patching*: Replacing activations with controlled values

- *Counterfactual analysis*: Examining alternative circuit configurations

## Circuit Motifs and Computational Patterns

Understanding common circuit motifs provides insight into the fundamental computational building blocks that neural networks use to implement complex algorithms.

### Equivariant Circuits and Symmetry

Many neural network behaviors exhibit equivariance to transformations, implemented through specialized circuit structures that preserve important symmetries in the data.

**Equivariance in Neural Circuits:** Many neural network behaviors exhibit equivariance to transformations, implemented through specialized circuit structures.

**Translation Equivariance:** Circuits that respond consistently to spatial translations:

$$f_{\mathcal{C}}(T_{\mathbf{v}} \mathbf{x}) = T_{\mathbf{v}} f_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathbf{x})$$

where $$T_{\mathbf{v}}$$ represents translation by vector $$\mathbf{v}$$.

**Implementation through Weight Sharing:** Convolutional circuits achieve translation equivariance:

where $$S_s$$ represents scaling by factor $$s$$ and $$\alpha$$ is the scaling exponent.

### Union and Disjunction Circuits

$$\text{Attention}_{i,j} = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_j / \sqrt{d})}{\sum_k \exp(\mathbf{q}_i^T \mathbf{k}_k / \sqrt{d})}$$

### Hierarchical Composition Patterns

**Bottom-Up Hierarchies:** Information flow from simple to complex features:

## Reading Algorithms from Weights

One of the most powerful aspects of circuit analysis is the ability to directly read algorithmic implementations from the learned weight patterns of neural networks.

### Weight Pattern Analysis Methodology

**Systematic Weight Inspection:** Structured approaches to weight analysis:

1. Extract weight matrices for target circuit
2. Normalize weights for comparison
3. Identify dominant weight patterns
4. Compare to known algorithmic templates
5. Validate through synthetic reconstruction
6. Test predictions on novel inputs

**Statistical Analysis of Weight Distributions:** Understanding weight organization:

$$\text{Pattern Strength} = \frac{||\mathbf{w}_{\text{pattern}}||_2}{||\mathbf{w}_{\text{total}}||_2}$$

**Singular Value Decomposition:** Extracting principal weight patterns:

$$\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^T = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T$$

where dominant singular vectors reveal key computational patterns. Each term $$\sigma_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{v}_i^T$$ represents a rank-one matrix (an "outer product"), and the SVD decomposes $$\mathbf{W}$$ into a sum of these, ordered by the magnitude of the singular values $$\sigma_i$$. The vectors $$\mathbf{v}_i$$ (columns of $$\mathbf{V}$$ or rows of $$\mathbf{V}^T$$) form an orthonormal basis for the input space, and $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ (columns of $$\mathbf{U}$$) form an orthonormal basis for the output space. Each $$\mathbf{v}_i$$ can be thought of as an input pattern (or direction in input space) that the matrix $$\mathbf{W}$$ responds to, and the corresponding $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ is the output pattern (direction in output space) produced, scaled by $$\sigma_i$$. Thus, the leading singular value(s) and their associated vectors highlight the most significant linear transformations the weight matrix $$\mathbf{W}$$ performs.

**Template Matching:** Comparing learned weights to algorithmic templates:

$$\text{Similarity}(\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{T}) = \frac{\text{tr}(\mathbf{W}^T \mathbf{T})}{||\mathbf{W}||_F \cdot ||\mathbf{T}||_F}$$

### Classical Algorithm Recognition

**Convolution Kernel Analysis:** Identifying classical computer vision operations:

**Sobel Edge Detection:** Recognizing edge detection kernels:

$$\mathbf{S}_x = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{S}_y = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -2 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

**Gaussian Blur:** Identifying smoothing operations:

$$G_{i,j} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} \exp\left(-\frac{(i-\mu_i)^2 + (j-\mu_j)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

**Laplacian of Gaussian:** Detecting blob and keypoint operations:

$$\text{LoG}(x, y) = -\frac{1}{\pi\sigma^4}\left[1 - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right] \exp\left(-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$
