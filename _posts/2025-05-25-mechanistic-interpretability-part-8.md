In [Part 7]({% post_url 2025-05-25-mechanistic-interpretability-part-7 %}), we explored the general framework of neural network circuits and their computational patterns. Now we turn to one of the most important applications of circuit analysis: understanding **transformer circuits and attention mechanisms**. Building on the mathematical frameworks established in [Part 3]({% post_url 2025-05-25-mechanistic-interpretability-part-3 %}), we can now apply these tools systematically to analyze attention heads, understand information flow, and decode the computational algorithms that make transformers so powerful. Transformers represent the backbone of modern AI systems, from GPT to BERT to multimodal models, making their mechanistic understanding crucial for both scientific insight and practical AI safety.

## Transformer Architecture and Circuit Decomposition

Transformers present unique challenges for mechanistic interpretability that distinguish them from the vision models analyzed in earlier circuits work, but they also offer unprecedented opportunities for precise mathematical analysis.

### Architectural Overview for Circuit Analysis

**Residual Stream as Central Highway:** The transformer's residual stream serves as the primary communication channel between components:

$$\mathbf{x}^{(l+1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(l)} + \text{Attn}^{(l)}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}) + \text{MLP}^{(l)}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)} + \text{Attn}^{(l)}(\mathbf{x}^{(l)}))$$

**Component Independence:** Each attention head and MLP operates independently on the residual stream:

$$\text{Attn}^{(l)}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \text{Head}_h^{(l)}(\mathbf{x})$$

where $$H$$ is the number of attention heads in layer $$l$$.

**Linear Superposition:** The additive nature enables linear decomposition:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}^{(0)} + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{h=1}^{H} \text{Head}_h^{(l)}(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{MLP}^{(l)}(\mathbf{x})$$

**Virtual Weights and Effective Connectivity:** Components can influence each other through the residual stream:

$$\mathbf{W}_{\text{virtual}}^{(i \rightarrow j)} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{out}}^{(j)} \mathbf{W}_{\text{in}}^{(i)}$$

where component $$i$$ writes to the residual stream and component $$j$$ reads from it.

### Mathematical Framework for Circuit Analysis

**Path Expansion Methodology:** Decomposing model outputs into interpretable paths:

$$\text{logit}_c = \sum_{\text{paths } P} \text{Contribution}(P \rightarrow c)$$

**Direct Path Contributions:** Paths that go directly from input to output:

$$\text{Direct}(i \rightarrow c) = \mathbf{W}_{\text{unembed}}[c, :] \cdot \mathbf{W}_{\text{embed}}[:, i]$$

**Single-Component Paths:** Paths through individual attention heads or MLPs:

$$\text{Single}(i \rightarrow \text{comp} \rightarrow c) = \mathbf{W}_{\text{unembed}}[c, :] \cdot \text{comp}(\mathbf{e}_i)$$

**Multi-Component Paths:** Paths through multiple components:

$$\text{Multi}(i \rightarrow \text{comp}_1 \rightarrow \text{comp}_2 \rightarrow c) = \mathbf{W}_{\text{unembed}}[c, :] \cdot \text{comp}_2(\text{comp}_1(\mathbf{e}_i))$$

### Attention Head Decomposition Framework

**Bilinear Attention Mechanism:** The core attention computation:

$$\text{Attn}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) \mathbf{V}$$

**QK and OV Circuit Separation:** Attention heads can be decomposed into two independent circuits:

$$\text{QK Circuit:} \quad \mathbf{A}_{i,j} = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{W}_Q)(\mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{W}_K)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)$$

$$\text{OV Circuit:} \quad \mathbf{o}_i = \sum_j \mathbf{A}_{i,j} (\mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{W}_V) \mathbf{W}_O$$

**Effective Weight Matrices:** Combining QK and OV operations:

$$\mathbf{W}_{QK} = \mathbf{W}_Q \mathbf{W}_K^T$$

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} = \mathbf{W}_V \mathbf{W}_O$$

Note that if the input token representations $$\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j$$ are in $$\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}$$, and $$\mathbf{W}_Q, \mathbf{W}_K$$ project to $$\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{head}}}$$, then $$\mathbf{W}_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{head}}}$$ and $$\mathbf{W}_K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{head}}}$$. Thus, $$\mathbf{W}_{QK}^{\text{effective}} = \mathbf{W}_Q \mathbf{W}_K^T$$ would be a $$\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$$ matrix if we consider its action on the full token representations (i.e., $$(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{W}_Q)(\mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{W}_K)^T = \mathbf{x}_i (\mathbf{W}_Q \mathbf{W}_K^T) \mathbf{x}_j^T$$). This effective QK matrix shows how pairs of token representations in the residual stream are compared to produce attention scores. Similarly, if $$\mathbf{W}_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{head}}}$$ and $$\mathbf{W}_O \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{head}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$$, then $$\mathbf{W}_{OV} = \mathbf{W}_V \mathbf{W}_O$$ is a $$\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}} \times d_{\text{model}}}$$ matrix. This OV matrix describes the transformation applied to a value vector (derived from a token representation) before it's written back to the residual stream.

**Low-Rank Structure:** Attention matrices have inherent low-rank structure:

$$\text{rank}(\mathbf{W}_{QK}) \leq \min(d_{\text{model}}, d_{\text{head}})$$

## Attention Head Decomposition and Analysis

Understanding individual attention heads requires systematic decomposition of their query-key (QK) and output-value (OV) circuits, each serving distinct computational functions.

### Query-Key (QK) Circuit Analysis

**Attention Pattern Generation:** The QK circuit determines where each position attends:

$$\text{Attention Score}_{i,j} = \frac{(\mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{W}_Q) \cdot (\mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{W}_K)}{\sqrt{d_k}}$$

**Eigenvalue Decomposition of QK Matrix:** Understanding attention patterns through spectral analysis:

$$\mathbf{W}_{QK} = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol{\Lambda} \mathbf{U}^T = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \lambda_i \mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{u}_i^T$$

where $$\lambda_i$$ are eigenvalues and $$\mathbf{u}_i$$ are eigenvectors.

**Attention Pattern Classification:** Common QK circuit patterns:

**Previous Token Attention:** Attending to the immediately preceding token:

$$\mathbf{W}_{QK} \approx \alpha \cdot \text{Shift Matrix} + \text{noise}$$

where the shift matrix has ones on the sub-diagonal.

**Positional Attention:** Attending based on relative or absolute position:

$$\text{Score}_{i,j} = f(i - j) \text{ or } f(i, j)$$

**Content-Based Attention:** Attending based on token content similarity:

$$\text{Score}_{i,j} = \text{similarity}(\text{content}_i, \text{content}_j)$$

**Syntactic Attention:** Attending based on grammatical relationships:

$$\text{Score}_{i,j} = \text{syntactic\_relation}(\text{token}_i, \text{token}_j)$$

1. Extract attention patterns from model
2. Classify patterns by type (positional, content, syntactic)
3. Generate synthetic inputs to test hypotheses
4. Measure attention pattern consistency
5. Validate through ablation studies

### Output-Value (OV) Circuit Analysis

**Information Processing Function:** The OV circuit determines what information is moved:

$$\text{Output}_i = \sum_j \text{Attention}_{i,j} \cdot (\mathbf{x}_j \mathbf{W}_{OV})$$

**OV Matrix Decomposition:** Understanding information transformation:

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} = \mathbf{W}_V \mathbf{W}_O = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \sigma_i \mathbf{v}_i \mathbf{w}_i^T$$

where $$\sigma_i$$ are singular values, $$\mathbf{v}_i$$ are input directions, and $$\mathbf{w}_i$$ are output directions.

**Information Movement Patterns:** Common OV circuit functions:

**Copy Circuits:** Moving information without transformation:

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} \approx \mathbf{I} \text{ (identity matrix)}$$

**Translation Circuits:** Converting between different representations:

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} \approx \text{Linear transformation between semantic spaces}$$

**Projection Circuits:** Extracting specific features:

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} \approx \text{Low-rank projection onto feature subspace}$$

**Inhibition Circuits:** Suppressing specific information:

$$\mathbf{W}_{OV} \approx -\alpha \cdot \text{Feature projection}$$
