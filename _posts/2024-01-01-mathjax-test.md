This is a test post to verify that MathJax is working correctly.

## Inline Math

Here is some inline math: \(\alpha + \beta = \gamma\) and another one: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\).

## Display Math

Here is a display equation:

$$E = mc^2$$

And another using different delimiters:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
\]

## More Complex Equations

The quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Greek letters: \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon\)

Subscripts and superscripts: \(x_1^2 + x_2^2 = r^2\)

If you can see all the math expressions properly formatted, then MathJax is working!
