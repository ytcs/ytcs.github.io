Some qualitative aspects of market behavior can be understood via trader behavior. Broadly speaking there are two types of traders - those that react to asset price, and those that react to trend (first derivative of asset price). We shall call the first type mean-reversal traders (**MR**) since they tend to buy low and sell high which creates a stabilizing (mean-reversal) effect on the asset price. The second type of traders are trend-followers (**TR**) since they tend to follow the current price trend, i.e. buy when price is rising and sell when price is falling, which tends to create a positive-feedback effect that solidifies or at times boosts the current market trend.

Three scenarios:
 1. If the market is dominated by MR traders, then the price will tend to stay flat, i.e. the first derivative of price will be small or near-zero. TR traders will not be interested in participating in the market. Thus, flat, consolidating markets are MR dominated.
 
 2. If the market is trending up strongly, MR traders will be very quickly priced out of the market. Thus market with a strong uptrend are TR dominated.
 
 3. If the market is trending downwards, both MR and TR traders will participate and we expect market participation and thus traded volume to be the highest. The mixing of MR and TR behaviors also makes this type of market more difficult to understand than (1) or (2).
