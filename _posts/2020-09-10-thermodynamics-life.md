title:  "Thermodynamics of Self-replicating Systems"
---
In 2013 Jeremy England published an interesting inequality which is essentially the equivalent of Landauer's bound for biology.

He derived a non-equilibrium generalization of the second law:

{% katex display %}
\beta \Delta Q_{I\toII} + \ln \Big( \frac{\pi(II\to I)}{\pi(I\to II}\Big) + \Delta S_{int} \geq 0
{% endkatex %}

where I represents the macrostate of having a single organism and II represents the macrostate where the organism replicated into two. Using a simple exponential model with growth rate g and decay rate {% katex display %} \delta{% endkatex %}, we can express the tranistion probabilities in terms of these rates:

{% katex display %}
{% endkatex %}
